### Week 5 Tasks Completed
- [x] No Playtest for this week 
- [x] Programming Tasks:

    - [x] A bug arrised where dialogue is called multiple times during a quest, which Allie fixed after discussing with us

    - if you don't know how big the map is, the walk speed might be an issue  
    - music: add sound to footsteps, and opening the book to make world feel more alive
    - Design feedback:
        - Shorten map and run key
        - maps aren't bad, but the destroyed town didn't seem destroyed (cloud a few buildings)
