Sprint 3. This week is cram week, the QA team is trying to get rid of all temp assests and backlog tasks to prepare for next week's playtests starting again. Important times.


### Week 5 Tasks Completed
- [x] Studio Meeting (2 hours)
- [x] No Playtest for this week, playtests will resume next week when all of the encounters are added to the game and we can get quality feedback
- [x] Programming Tasks:
  - [x] Fixed a Fungi Repeat Dialogue Bug where the player had to go through the entire quest dialgoue again to fight the Fungi
    - [x] Playtesters and programmers complained about the long sequencing of dialogue. 
      - [x] Wanted to implment a feature that after one dialogue activation and player defeat, shortens the dialogue sequencing and jumps to battle
      - [x] Created new dialogue objects and changed quest sequencing for minigame controller, previous quests, and post in Fungi for Forest Scene
    - [x] First time I used the dialogue controller. Learnt how to use it now in case I get assigned tasks from narrative and quest sequencing in the future. 
  - [x] Fixed left fungi dialogue bug where after battle the fungi said wrong dialgoue
    - [x] Fixed in minigame and dialogue controller


### Week 6 Tasks Completed
- [x] Studio Meeting (2 hours)
- [x] WolverineSoft Studio General Playtest on Friday (1 hour in the BBB)
- [x] I made a mistake with my fungi implementation, and had to fix. (; _ ;)
  - [x] Even though I tested the save, I broke the quest chain sequencing from the begining of the scene.
  - [x] Fixed with Allie, and learnt to pay more attention to referenced objects in Game Controller and Dialogue Controller and Quest Controller
- [x] POLISH + BACKLOG FEATURES assigned from QA 
  - [x] Player movement feels a bit slow considering the size of the mapÂ 
    - [x] increased player movement speed by 20%
  - [x] After the new implmenetation, village + revisit + repaired bridge scene and make sure new assets are playtested and connected 
    - [x] Talked to every NPC in Village, Revist, and Repaired Bridge (30+ characters) to double check their portraits
      - [x] Unfortuantely they were not connected after art finished drawing them.  
        - [x] Call Allie and Samuel how to discuss NPC Profile linking to dialogue.
        - [x] Created 10 new NPCDialogueObjects, 10 new CharacterExpression Objects for new NPCS
        - [x] Relinked 30+ characters dialogue and overworld NPC objects
          - [x] Playtested all dialgoue interactions in village scene ...  a lot
    - [x] Fixed wrongly referenced NPC objects. There is a lot of scrapped objects where NPC portraits are refered to but don't exist. Deleted diaglogue triggers. 
    - [x] Bad uses of prefabs, caused multiple dialogue model layering bugs when switching to new art. 
       - [x] Created four new NPC prefabs, with their own controllers, and replaced their old templates.
       - [x] Added my own dialogue into the game because narrative did not delete the temp dialogue. Sick! Putting my creative writing minor to good use.
  -[x] some of the market villagers sprites render weirdly, make sure their layering and pivot are correct and everything looks clean when the player walks around them
    - ![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}images/screenshot/clipping-issues-week8.png)
    - [x] Fixed in Unity so the player stands above the NPCS

Todo Notes:
- Run feels a bit bad. You have to press shift while running to sprint. Change the state logic so if you are already holding shift, you can still run when moving.
