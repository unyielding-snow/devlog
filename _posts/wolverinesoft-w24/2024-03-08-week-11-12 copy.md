Final week!! :(

### Week 9
- Studio Meeting (2 hours)
- Bunch of miselaneous tasks from all over the place:
    - Playtest whole game (1 hour)
    - Created two new secret achievements for our Steam page (Need a toal of 10 to publish)
        - Used the event bus system, and also created a new item collection system to trigger the unlock condition for new collectables
    - Created new scenes and interiors for houses and town hall so characters can actually go into them now instead of being locked out
        - This ties into our quest line where we have to go inside the town hall to destroy the player's save point
    - Various polish implementation:
        - Changed the dialogue and art of the Mob so it actually meakes sense now
            - Mob will be angry before they attack you, and in all subsequent dialogues will be sad after you defeat them
            - Mob were also impacted in the cutscenes, so looked into cutscene manger. 
        - Created new bridge for village, revisit, repaired-bridge scenes as the old hitbox was really terrible (it went diagonal and players kept on glitching on it)
        - Implmeneted save game icon and other missing sprites 

 
### Week 9
- Studio Meeting (2 hours)
- BUG BASH CRAM NIGHT ON WEDNESDAY (4+ hours)
    - Had a bug bash party at Allie's place with the programming and QA team. 
        - Fixed numerous backlog tasks from Leo 
            - Re-did the castle scene scene, the tile map and colliders according to design team specs last minute
            - Various level fixes on village scenes 
            - in Forest changed trees and shrub to match intended art (so they are not the same trees as the ones in village)
            - Removed auto tree generation (the trees in our game spawn randomly every time we load the scene) as made some NPCs unfindable at certain locations
            - Just straight up adding our own content into the game at this point because the writers and designers did not give us too much instructions...
                - Made new scenes and character interactions for village revisit (before all the previous NPCs you interacted with in village just did not show up in revisit)
        - Petted Allie's cat 
        - More playtests to discover on the fly bugs we instantly patched



### Hours Breakdown
- Studio Meetings: 4 hours + 30 minute overtime
- Everything else goes crazy
